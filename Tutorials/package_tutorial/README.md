A src/ may have multiple packages. Essentially you create a workspace and distribute your packages. Each package will have its own file structure (CMake vs Python).


From the tutorials, a trivial workspace may look like this:

```
workspace_folder/
    src/
      cpp_package_1/
          CMakeLists.txt
          include/cpp_package_1/
          package.xml
          src/

      py_package_1/
          package.xml
          resource/py_package_1
          setup.cfg
          setup.py
          py_package_1/
      ...
      cpp_package_n/
          CMakeLists.txt
          include/cpp_package_n/
          package.xml
          src/
```
